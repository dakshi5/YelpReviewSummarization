I have the following comments.  \n\n1- The Emergency Room was outstanding in triaging my father and coordinating his care.  EXCELLENT.  \n\n2- For the most part, nursing care was excellent.  Most of the nursing staff (RN and CNA) were exceptional but there were deficits at times.    \n\n3- Unfortuately, there are significant financial pressures on hospitals to increase the number of patients per nurse.  This requires family assistance at times in order to maximize patient care.  I found myself having to assist with transfers, insist upon diaper changes, demand that my family member be transferred from bed to chair, and demand that skin integrity be evaluated on a daily basis.  \n\n4- As with any hospital, be aware that discharge planning is initiated on DAY ONE.  Medicare determines length of stay for any given diagnosis so hospitals only make money if they meet these guidelines.  All hospitals are extremely aggressive on discharging patients quickly in order to avoid a loss of revenue and CMC is no exception.   \n\n5- Nutritional determinations are nonsensical at best.  \n\n6- There is parking lot transportation for 'handicapped' and elderly.  However, I saw a preponderance of obese people utilizing onsite transportation in order to arrive at hospital entrances.  It seems nonsensical to post marketing flyers everywhere inside the facility about 'pre-diabetes' yet endeavor to minimize exercise.  \n\n7- The facility was safe.  \n\n8- Characteristic of the US healthcare, CARE IS FRAGMENTED and not coordinated despite significant time spend by nursing on entering data into portable computers.  This phenomenon will not improve with either Obamacare or EPIC (computerized medical records).    \n\n9- PHYSICAL THERAPY WAS EXCELLENT.  \n\n10- Much time is wasted waiting for physicians, social work, physical therapy and any other referral to arrive in the patient's room.

I could accept them telling us that they were unsure of a diagnosis, or anything close to one, and referring us to someone else.

I let them know I would be Breastfeeding but, once my son was born, he was rushed to the nicu. I didn't get to hold my son until three days later! He had jaundice and the nurses didn't want me to pick him up. I complied because I wanted my baby better so I could hold him in my arms. Due to the fact that I wasn't allowed to hold him and they were giving him pacifiers and bottle nipples he never really learned to latch on! I was so frustrated with this hospital. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and went back for a tubal ligation, just to find out after being prepped for surgery that the consulting doctor failed to inform us that I need to be on birth control in order to have the surgery.

You can find parking validation in a few places. 1) information desk in the main tower slash lobby. 2) information desk over by the pharmacy and 3) sneak into the Sanger waiting area and look for the basket with a boatload of slips of paper.\n\nBelieve me, even they know no one carries cash and they have free parking available. But why they don't make this information more easily available is beyond me.\n\nThe cafeteria on level 3 is really nice with a huge amount of options. The food is better than edible.  I've found some really good things. And Ms. Easter always puts a smile on my face with her positive attitude.\n\nThe waiting room on the 5th floor for surgery is really nice but I wish they had more electrical outlets. They have a bar area with a lot of electrical outlets but, I'm embarrassed to admit, they had to point it out.  There's two Keurig's - one for coffee and one for tea. They have 2 regular coffee and 1 decaff and 1 tea (english breakfast). So bring your own if you have a favorite.  The bathrooms were very close and clean. I loved how they had a big board to track your loved one.\n\nOh, why was I there. Ok, pull out your hankies. On my brother's birthday, he called saying he thought he was having a heart attack. He was told to hang up & call 911. Which he did. He was flown into Carolinas and stabilized. He had an aortic tear. (people, if someone tells you that you have high blood pressure, please listen to them and don't blow it off)\n\nFloor 7's special ICU for cardiac patients was amazing. I had taken a red eye from SFO to CLT and somehow found the hospital (it's not too hard to get there, but i admit, I had trouble finding parking) It was easy to check into the Information desk in the tower and head up & shock my brother. He was released down to the 6th floor and the staff were great there as well. He got released but we knew he had to go back for surgery. I wish I had written down the names of the nursing staff when I was there, but I was pretty freaked out. Everyone was professional and did an excellent job.\n\nSo, that's why I'm here now. Surgery went well. Dr. Boyes had evaluated him initially and his gut was correct to wait. I'd trust him with any aortic tear I had. Two stents were put in after a bypass. My brother was very well cared for by Missy and Mona and Antonette in 11th floor ICU. He did have a complication that's well known and the team was on it like a dog on a bone. I'm like \"are you sure...\" YES. \"ok, ok\" :-)  I am a force of nature but even I know when to back down.\n\nThey've sent an occupational therapist to start working with him for when he's back home.\n\nI'm looking forward to when he's released this time, but for now, I'm confident he's getting the best care.\n\nOk, ok, the ding? Hello, the bathroom on the 11th floor was not serviced today. It ran out of paper towels around 1130. I'm sorry but please, you need to service all your restrooms even if it's on a weekend.

These gals give comfort and support to the child and the child's family. They use their abilities to engage with kids and make medical procedures less scary for them. Everyone in this ER was wonderful. We are talkin' top docs and nurses here, got it?!\n\nIf your child is admitted to the hospital proper, you will get an ID that you wear outside of your room. This ID is literally a key to your floor and certain other areas. Other places require passes that the nurses give out. Parking is validated. \n\nThe rooms are big and clean. They have two IKEAish sofas that turn into \"beds\" with the removal of cushions. There is a huge dry erase board that you can write notes on. Plenty of counterspace, sink, and the medical staff has a \"workspace\" to input data. Tons of storage, TV with DVD, thermostat, mini fridge, good lighting, and housekeeping to boot. They even put a sign outside the door letting others know certain things about the patient (e.g.\"fall risk\"). Vitals are checked often.  \n\nThe nurse hub has a secretary who can answer any question you have. They do indeed give you vouchers every day of your stay for delicious cafeteria food. Use the whole voucher- once you use it, that's it- no change. The cafeteria had decent hours- no closing at 7 pm junk, but not open till 12 am either (I am talking about the hot stuff- I think it is open at all hours with sandwiches, fruit, yogurt, chips). Very well stocked. In the mornings, near the elevators, they have free assorted coffees and muffins. It's a morning chill-spot, attached to another room with sofas and a TV. Get there early if you are picky. It goes fast.\n\nThis hospital gives you all you could possibly need. Just ask- you will be surprised at what they have. They have a laundry room with detergent. If you are waiting for a person to put their clothes in the dryer, just do it for them. It is in order to keep the system going. Otherwise, you could wait hours. Just across, there is a snack room. You can get free snack stuff- juice, milk, pudding, Jello, crackers, cereal, peanut butter. They got it all. \n\nYou can go to playrooms on certain floors at certain times. They are staffed by volunteers and have many tables. There are toddler toys, but if you have an older kid they can open up the craft closet and give you craft stuff. You can watch a movie. You can play video games. You can borrow \"Star Wars\" for the TV back in your room. You might get a teddy or a toy. I like the older volunteers as opposed to the younger ones in their twenties.  \n\nTo get fresh air, you could go to an outside area on a lower floor. We would go up to the tippy top, to the outside garden floor. We would relax in lounge chairs and watch a movie on a big screen under a porch. You could sit in the sun, too, and mess with interactive sculpture stuff. It felt secret and cozy, and had great views. You might see a helicopter take off above you. Inside, there is a bathroom. \n\nThey even have a \"radio station\" in the front lobby, and you can see what's going on in there from your TV. You can request a song, and even play bingo with the DJs; when you win, a prize is delivered to your room. There was a movie night with popcorn. A toiletries cart comes around and hooks you up if you need deodorant, toothbrushes, mags, and they even have books. Bridget the therapy dog visited us, and it really made my daughter smile.

The Chick fil A in the hospital is salt-free. There is a walking path by a stream in front of the hospital. The corner has a security guard. \n\nLike I said, you are getting the topmost care. Most nurses and their helpers are kind, helpful, and work hard; same with the doctors. They are compassionate and intelligent. They communicate well. They make you feel comfortable. One doc that we saw only once remembered us and took the time to say hello to us in the cafeteria. You can call them with any questions after you leave. We had an appointment snafu, and our doctor took the time to see my daughter even though he is a busy guy. \n\nBills, comments, and even body language from others have given me clues as to how darn sick my kid was. Our doc told us the situation; processing came later for me. The sudden fear was and is surreal, but this hospital kept me grounded enough to get through. Today my kid is healthily craving H&M merchandise, listening to Bowie, and drawing half-mermaid cats with six-packs. And it is because of Levine.\n\nDedicated to the 8th floor \"Cheeseburglar\", who made me smile.", "review_id": "w3XaTmdJ26728uD_3d-Diw", "type": "review", "user_id": "6FBuohzwWTQn6rBLRPElQQ", "business_id": "BilwFx6EJoFzni0E6vRkbw"}, {"votes": {"cool": 0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0}, "date": "2015-03-13", "stars": 2, "text": "Levine Children's Hospital has a fantastic reputation on a national level!  We're privileged to have such a medical facility in this area.  I need to be honest though; our stays haven't been the best.  I do realize that, sometimes, someone experiences several unfortunate experiences which cause the overall experience to be borderline miserable.  \n\nTo make a long story short, PROS - GREAT floor staff that have empathetic bedside manners and expertise too.  CONS - My child has had two major surgeries, both of which resulted in complications and infections.  In the first surgery, we never received a phone call from the surgeon or his staff...and this was considered brain surgery!  In the second surgery, the result of the complications, the \"look\" of the incision, and the lack of concern of the surgeon was just too much for us.  Another \"less-than-pleasant\" experience was found by the staff in the ER.  \n\nI honestly can't suggest anyone NOT go there!  I truly think we had back luck...multiple times!  There are too many who've had life-changing experiences.  Good for y'all; continue to support LCH.  As for us, we'll continue to go to Greenville Memorial Hospital.", "review_id": "leIIGEkX876kyy0n0aCLMQ", "type": "review", "user_id": "5ziDIgZ9-hUT0O3_e9iPnA", "business_id": "BilwFx6EJoFzni0E6vRkbw"}]
