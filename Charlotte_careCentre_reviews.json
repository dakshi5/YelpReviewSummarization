While I normally go to the Dowd YMCA because it has a full basketball court and pool, the Gateway Y is great for a quick, simply work-out at any time. \n\nThe Gateway Y has about 30 treadmills, 15 bikes, and 10 other cardio machines, all stationed in front of TVs. It also has an adequate amount of weightlifting equipment. There are two locker rooms, a stretching area, one or two \"class\" rooms, and that's about it. And really, that's all you need. Everything's clean, everything's new and nice; it's a perfect space for a workout without too many frills--or even the added distraction of running into everyone you know in Charlotte. \n\nIt's gets kinda crowded from 5-7 pm (after work hours), but it's never too bad, and it's certainly much thinner during the morning and later evening hours. The Y offers quite a few classes, most of which are pretty awesome if that's your thing. \n\nI go because it's close and it's easy.", "review_id": "VjbMZakTAfgS1tCWUxUqWA", "type": "review", "user_id": "kDYpTc-yc8UAxCs_LhX1yA", "business_id": "1lk-nBvl-mxV2PXLb29xBw"}, {"votes": {"cool": 1, "useful": 1, "funny": 0}, "date": "2010-12-20", "stars": 4, "text": "In comparison to the other nearby YMCAs (Dowd, Childress) Gateway is a bit dwarfed.

You'll also find a small selection of benches and hand weights and a small area to stretch.\n\nWhile I haven't made it to a class here as of yet, it's mainly because the Dowd is closer to my house.

Even if you can't walk here, there are two different parking lots you can use.  However, the one located on the side street only allows gym members to use it after 5 PM, and you will have to get the gate code in advance.\n\nWhat I really like about this place is the customer service.  The employees are RIGHT there when you walk in.  I always get a warm greeting.  When I first started, I received a tour of the gym and a consultation.  This included my weigh-in, all my measurements taken and a discussion of my goals.  Any time I work out I could ask someone to retake my measurements and I can use the scale freely at anytime.  They also offer personal fitness training options (pay service) and they have a nice variety of free group classes that can be taken from open to close!  \n\nBecause this has more of an \"express gym\" feel to it, all of the cardio and weightlifting equipment is within close proximity.

As a result, getting in and out of this YMCA takes significantly less time than other gyms.  It also is much much less crowded than the Dowd or Uptown/Childress Klein YMCA, likely because it has no pool or gym.  This YMCA also has  great group exercise classes. Meredith's Turbokick class is really incredible and, for me, sets the bar for all other aerobic classes at other Ys. The room for the spinning classes is a little dingy, but it is private and generally has good instructors. My only complaint is that this gym doesn't have more exercise classes because the facility here, while small, is much more pleasant than at the other YMCAs. It is also a little more difficult to get to from Uptown than the Childress Klein YMCA, which is a shame because I would much rather work out here. Instead, it tends to be a better before and after work gym.  Also, it isn't usually open on Sunday, which is unfortunate. \n\nAlso, because this gym is so close to Johnson and Wales, there tends to be a lot of younger folks here.

I keep going back to them, so that is sure to say something. I live very close to the Dowd Y and sometimes will run to this location or hop in my car to catch a class, even though I can walk to the Gateway location (which I do on some days when I don't have much time). \n\nPros: \n-Some people may consider this a con but I LIKE the fact that it is busy and very fast paced. As soon as I walk in the door, I can feel the buzz and excitement that everyone here is truly pumped to work out and better themselves. \n-The Dowd Y has a TON of classes and a varied schedule so you can choose the type of class for you at any time during the day whether it be before work, around lunch time or after work. I would suggest trying the Athletic Conditioning class if you like a challenge! The YMCA's of Great Charlotte posts their monthly exercise class schedule so you can prepare your workout routine in advance. I would like to say these classes are a great way to meet new people, but I am not one to chat while at the gym.. so that may be up to you to introduce yourself to fellow Y-goers. \n-This Y has a very young member base. I also like this. There are a few older members, who I would say are mainly men, that frequent here but not as many as the other Y's around the Charlotte area. \n-The staff is always friendly and most of them say Hello as you pass. I have never had a bad experience with any staff of any YMCA for that matter. They give off the vibe that they truly enjoy what they do! =) \n\nCons: \n-Parking is terrible at times. Mainly around lunch time and especially right after people get out of work from 5-7pm. But don't worry, you WILL find a space. You may just have to circle around the lot a time or two to find one. No biggie. \n-Around the same times, you may also have to wait for a cardio machine in the cardio area on the main level. This one can kind of be a pain in the ass, and probably isn't such a big issue at other Y's. When I show up around busy times and cannot get a treadmill or elliptical right away, I will usually wait a few minutes until someone gets off and offers me their equipment or I will lift weights first and come back to cardio later. Either one always works. So keep this in mind when you show up straight from work. There WILL be waiting times on certain pieces of equipment. \n-Layout: The set up of the Dowd Y is so strange, but considering it is in uptown I guess it makes sense. It is squished into a taller building, so a gym of this size covers several floors and it is confusing!! I still get lost and cannot find certain machines at times. I would suggest getting a tour from a staff member when you sign up, although they usually do that anyway. The cardio area on the main level (which is level 2) is really small and has a strangely low ceiling for a cardio area. It is the typical height of an office building ceiling so if you are not used to it, you may feel a little claustrophobic. I have always been used to gyms that are more spread out, spacious with higher ceilings, so frequenting this gym was an adjustment for me, but not one that I couldn't handle. \n\nIn conclusion, The cons are very minute compared to the pros of this Uptown gym. You could join the Sports and Fitness, which is only a block away from the Dowd Y, for half the price, but you would not be getting the size, variety of fitness classes and sense of community that you would receive at the Dowd YMCA. I pay $40 a month at the Dowd Y and can cancel whenever I need to. No contracts or sign up fee, and it is a monthly draft. This $40 a month also includes the use of the OTHER 2 YMCA's in the uptown area as well! I definitely think this is a much better deal than the close competitor Sports and Fitness. $40 for a monthly gym membership is very reasonable for downtown in a larger city.", "review_id": "HaQlsSzjk1At6QdRm581hw", "type": "review", "user_id": "-3akdU5UTDn6dwiTCO2cAw", "business_id": "b3u-GK6_xj2fJkinzLk_jQ"}, {"votes": {"cool": 0, "useful": 2, "funny": 0}, "date": "2011-06-16", "stars": 5, "text": "So since I have given up on Inner Peaks (boo) I have needed a new gym to get myself back into shape...a couple friends recommended Dowd and after a tour I was convinced this would be a great place for me. \n\nWow this gym is like Globo gym in Dodge-Ball!  7 (or 8??) floors, pretty much every type of service you could look for....smoothie bar, dietician, towel service etc. \n\n  They keep things fun and interesting with unique classes ..so since I get bored easily this is the main attraction for me!

I just realize I haven't written about it.  Look, I am not a big exercise/workout person. And I remember years ago when I first thought about joining, this place intimidated the heck out of me.  Now that I have been a member for awhile, I highly appreciate what it has to offer:\n1. No annoying kids/teens.  Sorry if I offend some people, but it is hard enough for me to drag myself to workout. I don't want to be babysitting and/or have to listen to some teenage drama.  The general demographic here is young professional.  They have a kids room for the very little ones when the parents are using the Y, but overall no kids running around like the other Ys in the suburb.  \n2. Towel service. They have small towels for wiping sweat as well as bath towels for locker room usage.  Excellent perk!\n3. Great hours.  It opens until 10pm weekdays. It opens early but it doesn't affect me, I am not a morning person :)\n4. Great facilities.  It has so much to offer, from great group classes (at all hours), to pool, basketball court, indoor running track, racquet ball courts and the equipments.  My personal fav is the steam room and sauna. \n\nYes, the parking can be challenging but after a while you can figure out when and where is the best.

Normally I'm a regular at the south Charlotte Y's (Morrison, Harris & Siskey) but since it's a new year, I figured I'd try my hand at visiting this Y after work, since it's only about 1.5 miles from my office. The reviews here helped to convince me to give it a try, so I figured I'd write my own review as well to add to the information.\n\nI showed up around 4:45 and managed to find a spot. As soon as I walked through the turnstile I went to the guest relations desk and asked the woman behind the counter if she could direct me to the women's locker rooms. She offered right there to give me a full tour, so I took her up on the offer.\n\nThe facility is large, and as others have remarked, bustling. There were multiple basketball courts, two sets of lap lanes in the swimming pool (one warm, one cold), and all the other features you'd expect at a gym: spin room, tons of cardio machines just about everywhere you turned, machined weights and free weights. They had several stretch assisting machines and devices throughout the main gym area as well.\n\nThe women's locker room is indeed huge, and it's overwhelming at first. Lockers abound (I think there are almost too many, there's no way these fill up at 100%). I only found two toilet stalls in the women's locker room, but I'm pretty sure I must have missed another set somewhere. \n\nOne thing to note: You need a full-sized padlock for these lockers. I have used a small luggage style combo lock at the Harris for a long time, but it doesn't fit the lockers at the Dowd. Fortunately, they'll let you borrow a keyed lock with a driver's license.\n\nThere are a limited number of machines (perhaps a dozen or two, treadmills, ellipticals, stair steppers, recumbent bikes and rowing machines) and free weights in the women's locker room, and most of them were in use. I opted to climb onto one of the stair stepping machines for 20 minutes to start. After that I wandered the rest of the gym and hopped on a treadmill for a few more minutes. The stair stepper action (it's been awhile since I've used a stair stepper) caused my calf to tighten up uncomfortably, so I only spent another 20 minutes on the treadmill. It's January and as you can imagine, the place is packed to the gills.\n\nI decided to ease off and hit the steam room, which let's face it, is the real reason I go to the Y (well, this one and Harris, at least). I just force myself to exercise before I get to the \"reward\".\n\nAnd this is where the Dowd Y fell short for me. The steam room was the driest steam room I've used, and the full, bright lighting made it  less relaxing than the one at the Harris. It's not serene and quiet, people chat and talk loudly in this steam room. \n\nBoth the Dowd & the Harris Y have spray bottles of eucalyptus from a \"Club Aroma\" spa supply place. The eucalyptus bottle at the Harris Y is occasionally running on empty, but when it's filled it is good stuff. The \"eucalyptus\" at the Dowd was non-existent. They're cutting it so much with water (I presume) that it smells like nothing. The eucalyptus not only helps with opening nasal passages, it also makes the steam rooms smell nice, and this one - since there's no real eucalyptus to spray - smelled decidedly NOT nice.\n\nFinally, there's something else others have touched on a bit: the rampant nudity in the locker rooms. Here's the thing - I'm a bit of a prude about nakedness, being as I was raised in the south and taught the naked human form was an evil tool of the devil and all. But in a locker room, I realize that's mostly MY problem, and that the occasional flash of full frontal or a butt is the price you pay for dressing and undressing around other women. \n\nThere's a difference between flashes of nudity, and the women walking around the Dowd Y locker room for two hours, acting like they're in a nudist colony. Seriously, not a stitch on one particular older woman for two hours, as she stretched, dried her hair, lounged in chairs, and rubbed lotion on her face. I'm real glad for her that she's comfortable with the body she's got, but *I'M* not comfortable with it, and seeing her with her legs kicked up on the chair outside the steam room every time I entered it, just letting it all hang out, was disturbing. And it's not just about looks, I don't care how aesthetically pleasing your naked form might be, at least show a little courtesy and a slight amount of modesty.\n\nI didn't find the steam room or the locker room relaxing after my workout at all last night. I saw things no human should have to see, frankly. I appreciate it's close to my office, but I've heard Childress-Klein is too, and a little better about these sorts of things. I'd recommend the Dowd Y, but only to people who really honestly don't care about having strange women exhibitionists waving stuff around in their faces while in the locker room.

Weight room staff please gently nudge people to get off their blasted phones (emailing, txting, changing their music whatever) & not letting people work in between sets. Also the music in the weight room is TOO LOUD (& terrible)..

The best thing at Uptown branch, though, is its huge pool--great for laps and other water workouts.

I think I pay more in taxes than I actually net on the small amount of additional income it gets me, so I'd hope any bias I have is well-tempered.\n\nAs someone whose been to almost all the county's Ys, I'm a big fan of the C-K.  Tucked into the Wachovia (now Wells Fargo???) One building, and adjacent to the Hilton, this beacon of sweat calls to the uptown corporate crowd and those in town for just a few nights.  Hint: almost all the traveling shows for the performing arts center give their crew and cast passes to come and use this Y.  I've met dancers, singers, and performers of most of the bigger shows here.  Humorist David Sedaris (and his sister), for example, were in town recently for a one night performance- they both came to swim and had a great time (he even mentioned the visit during the show!).\n\nSo why this Y?  3 main reasons.  First, this place is not so gargantuan that you would get lost making your way from the lockers to the gym floor.  This also means the crowds are manageable and people tend to know the other people around.  I don't find this so much at the Dowd, for example.  The friendly aires here are just a little more appealing both for motivational and enjoyment of the visit purposes.  \n\nSecond, the cardio and weight equipment is well-maintained and logically laid out.  They just put in new free weights and redesigned that part of the gym with some new machines to boot- which was a nice upgrade.  People here generally care enough to wipe down the machines after they are done and don't mind letting you work in for sets.  When you are on a schedule, this helps.\n\nThird, everything you want is here in one place.  Group Ex classes, a pool, an indoor track, personal training and basketball half court.  If you get hungry, check out the food bar at the entrance- it's get a nice selection of food options that aren't fried or wrapped in cheese and bread.  I also find at least the men's locker room to be amply sized, with plenty of shower stalls, a steam room, a sauna, and plenty of lockers for day use.  \n\nLunchtime tends to be busiest, but the early morning crowd gets decently sized too.  The after work rush is much more subdued lately, no real idea why.  If you want the place almost to yourself, come in between 8:30 am - 11:00 am or 2:30 pm - 5:00 pm.  Amazing how things empty out then.  \n\nOne note of clarification- parking is free for up to 2.5 hours in the Wachovia/Hilton deck so long as your are out before 8:30 am or enter after 4:30 pm.  The times do not apply on the weekends, though I am sure the gym here is closed completely on Sundays.  Whatever you do, just make sure you stamp your parking ticket with the Y stamp at the entrance.  The parking deck attendants have little mercy for those who do not follow the restrictions.  Comprende?\n\nI'm a morning person and the best part of this gym, for me, is the community of regulars who also make the daily pilgrimage to burn some calories before the sun rises.  There are some serious athletes who train like crazy and some desk jockeys who live for their exercise highs outside of the office (that's my hand raised in the back of the room).  In all, it is a great mix of people who will open up if you take the time to talk to them.  Join one of the early morning running groups or become one of the die-hards looking for some self-inflicted punishment in one of the boot-camp style fitness classes- whatever your flavor of exercise, you can find it here and all in one nice, compact easy to access place.", "review_id": "94MlJvECQQsk6bf_bUhOwQ", "type": "review", "user_id": "Ul93T_U5jDh1FIIpiiTxuw", "business_id": "M89_KGMzLmdevtAlC_Ufsg"}, {"votes": {"cool": 2, "useful": 2, "funny": 2}, "date": "2011-02-01", "stars": 4, "text": "The Childress Klein (or Uptown) Y is the best place to get in a great workout during the day if you work in that area.

It definitely gets crowded at that time, so if you can make it here during off-hours, it is a decent gym. Very clean and nice locker rooms.  Plus, I once lost a necklace here, and the cleaning staff found it and gave it back to me, so props for that.\n\nI do have some serious issues with this gym, though. I am a group exerciser, so my main problem is with the group exercise facilities, which seem to have just been thrown together without much thought. Most of the classes are just randomly held in one part of the gym that is separated from the rest of the gym by sheer netting. As a result, when you're exercising the entire gym can (and usually does) stare at you. There also isn't a mirror anywhere for you to check your form. The YMCA actually has a proper group exercise room hidden away in another part of the building where a few classes are held, but it isn't clearly marked at all, plus you have get a special pass from the front desk to even get to it--very inconvenient.  The spin classes are held in the middle of the running track , so while you are spinning, joggers, often engaged in loud conversation, are constantly running by you, which is pretty annoying.  In general, the classes taught here tend to be different than at other YMCAs--the instructors are older and the classes are very Jane Fonda-esque.  I've been to a lot of them and have found the spin classes and the Body Pump (group weightlifting) classes to be the most challenging and have the best instruction. I've never been to the Athletic Conditioning class, but it seems pretty intense, too.  That said, in general, I don't think the classes are as hard as what you find at the Dowd or the Gateway (the Turbokick classes here are in no way as good as the ones at Gateway and the Dowd YMCAs).\n\nThis gym does have great pool going for it. Unfortunately, it tends to be packed with jerky triathlete types who either don't know how or don't care to properly share the lanes. Again, when it is off-hours, the pool is much better. \n\nWhile this Y does have parking in the basement of the building, but it is a little dicey to get around, and I believe parking is only free during off hours.", "review_id": "lSeA-P53zY1d6uOH2Pu25g", "type": "review", "user_id": "CLmgCLKP95JKhf4kV5vP2A", "business_id": "M89_KGMzLmdevtAlC_Ufsg"}, {"votes": {"cool": 1, "useful": 2, "funny": 1}, "date": "2011-08-04", "stars": 3, "text": "If you are a stickler like I am for a treadmill with a tv then you wont like this YMCA.

I did take a cardio kickboxing class on Wed, enjoyed it until the instructor had to be substituted due to surgery and the replacement left a lot to be desired.  \nThe bad:\nI do agree with some above posts that the cardio equipment is pretty dated and the TVs on the wall are hard to see from most of them. Try to avoid the sqeeky treadmill in the middle. The crowding is pretty intense during peak times, so unless you can clear 2-3pm in your day, good luck. The lap pool is also a struggle to get a clear lane.\nThe ugly:\nThe folks that work here friendly, but I have to downgrade the stars due to my experience with Personal Training. It took a week for a call back from the scheduler the first time around and then another week for the first appointment. Also, if you are looking for motivation and a kick in the pants to get going, I highly recommend avoiding the late afternoon time slot, not much being offered with the current scheduled trainer there.

I haplessly grew a beard hoping to disguise at least some of the redness but found myself at times, leaning against cold metal just to cool my face.  I even bought the green tinted coverup that was supposed to, when applied correctly, turn redness to a color that matched my skin tone. I would try anything. Having had enough I contacted the Dermatologic Laser Center off Randolph Rd. and made an appointment to see Dr. Brown.  I arrived on time for my initial visit and upon checking in, the staff members greeting me were strangely unsubtle, very energetic and franc, quite frankly.  They scuttled me about through one exam room to the next finally settling on door number 4. At this point I had no idea what to expect when in walked a man whom at first glance could be mistaken for a pre-pubescent altar boy and not a 50+ year old. My hope was growing.  Dr. Brown's bedside manner and demeanor is incredibly unique.  His voice had a soothing lull to it yet his questions were pointed and his answers were matter-of-fact.  He confirmed my suspicions but gave me some reassurance about my treatment by giving me options. He suggested that I start by prescribing topical cream and antibiotics. His other option was potentially a more permanent solution. He suggested laser treatment that he performs on site.  He said I could setup an appointment anytime but only after exhausting my prescription refills.  I was reluctant at the thought of laser treatment at first but after about 3 months with the prescriptions I needed another option. The cream came with great results but required that I avoid the sun. Summer fast approaching which coincided with rosacea's time of year to flourish, the medicines would be too restrictive. I called his office to make an appointment for my 30 minute long laser treatment. When I arrived this time, the staff scuttled me to the only room with radiation symbols affixed to the door and surrounding frame. Dr. Brown walked in adorned with radiation garb, slathered my face with some numbing cream, and asked through his protective mask if I wanted the intense 1 time V-beam treatment or the 2-3 times medium to low treatment.  I told him to crank it up! He then did something that surprised me. He turned to me, lifted his goggles and mask, looked me in the eyes, and explained exactly what was about to happen.  He made it clear it would hurt and I would be scarred. He was not joking!  Imagine someone taking a rubber band and snapping it on your cheeks, nose and forehead 100 times. It was excruciating!  When the treatment was done and the proverbial smoke cleared, he turned to me again, lifted his goggles and mask, looked me in the eyes and told me \"You're not leaving until you have seen yourself in the mirror. I need to know that you are ok with what you see.  I need to see your physical reaction to what is looking back at you.\" This is what I like most about his treatment.  At every step, he wanted an educated patient.  He wanted no surprises. The scarring was difficult to look at but he and I agreed that I can function normally with just a few minor accommodations. I drove home shortly after treatment with the visor down at night, afraid of what other drivers would think.  I started looking better after 2 weeks of healing and after 3 months there wasn't a single purple scar or redness nor burning sensation anywhere!  I couldn't, and still can't believe it years later, that my rosacea is gone!  My self esteem has grown.  My thoughts of others looking at my face are gone.  My skin is smooth and I'm not reluctant to look in a mirror.  I got rid of the green cover-up and gained a sense of pride.

You go up to the third floor, check in, move to A, get seen.  If you need labs you move to B and something else was at C.  I didn't need to go there though.\nSince I booked online no one seemed to warn me to fast before this appointment, but I figured I would need to and fasted anyway.  I was right...they wanted to take my blood.  I was there on a Friday afternoon and the waiting room was nice and quiet and peaceful.  There were only a couple other people in the waiting room.\n\nI guess if you have no other pharmacy you stop by the one in the ground floor and you are good to go.  I didn't need any prescriptions and I have to mail order any recurring prescriptions anyway, but for one-time prescriptions it would save a lot of hassle.", "review_id": "3ETpEly6JPpD-smcF2Sl2w", "type": "review", "user_id": "gD2FceWxl711U2IJokXBAQ", "business_id": "6-JA99X_Hew1ZDbIeeZFTw"}, {"votes": {"cool": 1, "useful": 2, "funny": 0}, "date": "2013-01-29", "stars": 5, "text": "Six yelp stars *** *** !

Aug. 2012 Dr. Brantley ordered a few lab tests and told me that I'm fine and \"See you next year.\"  I got no answers to my concerns.  I tried to switch to another doctor in his office this year, Aug. 2013, hoping I would get more answers, and the staff said that they do not allow patients to switch doctors once you're established with another doctor.  I explained that I had only seen him one time, and had gotten no answers.  After 2 or 3 more phone conversations and lack of communication by staff, they finally allowed me to see another doctor on staff--Dr. Reddy.  I was so hopeful that I'd finally get some answers.  I explained all of my symptoms to Dr. Reddy, and she was very thorough and ordered many lab tests to figure out what was going on in my body.  After about a week, the nurse called me with the lab results.  I told her that I thought I would have a follow up appointment so that I could ask the doctor about my results.  She said that she didn't know, that she would ask.  I never heard back from her.  After two more weeks, I called to ask for the lab results to be mailed to me and to another doctor who was performing surgery on me and needed my most recent lab results.  Dr. Brantley's staff at Mecklenburg Medical Group Endocrinology faxed the lab results from the previous year rather than the current results, then left me a phone message saying that I was confused...that I had only seen Dr. Brantley once, not twice--showing that whomever types the messages in the computer is having serious communication problems.  I had never indicated that I'd seen Dr. Brantley twice, but that I needed the Aug. 2013 lab results faxed to the surgery doctor.  I finally got my current lab results mailed to me, and still have not been able to make a follow-up appointment with Dr. Reddy who ordered the lab tests done.  The staff does not seem willing to schedule a follow-up appointment saying that they don't think it's necessary.  I still do not have my questions answered regarding the bleeding and weight gain.

Always...\nAfter waiting in the office for an inordinate amount of time I had the audacity to search for a staff member to inquire when we would be seen.  I happened upon the eating area where I saw Dr. Gaffney two fisting Pizza Hut pizzas while speaking loudly through greasy pizza and fuchsia lipstick, smeared mouthfuls, \"I am having lunch right now.\"   As she impatiently masticated one slice, she held another in the other hand and hollered \"Someone will be with you shortly!\"  I responded \"okay, because I've been here since 11:00 this morning.\"  She responded curtly, \"I will be in shortly!\"  This was a revolting scene and an extremely unpleasant exchange.  \n\nCOMMUNICATIONS SKILLS:\nWhen she finally appeared in the doorway it was to tell me that I should have rescheduled when my sister couldn't be there, because \"while she welcomes me to the practice, I am muddying the waters with my presence, as they are used to dealing with my sister.\"  I explained to her as I explained to the other staff that my sister had been called away on an urgent matter, she repeated again louder this time, \"We are used to dealing with your sister.\"  \n\nBEDSIDE MANNER:\nShe never completed the appointments, did not address all the concerns of the visit, but still took my payments for the visits and rudely insisted that we reschedule.  When I asked her about making sure that we would be able to reschedule with the specialist she said curtly, \"that is my job to worry about that.  Just have your sister call and make another appointment.\"  \n\nOVERALL:\nThis is a physician whose practice must be so lucrative that she is trying to drive her patients away with her nauseating disposition, unprofessional attitude and completely, unacceptable bedside manner.  My nephews asked me, \"Why is she being so mean to you Auntie?  Did you do something really bad to her?\"   I actually did not know what to tell them.  This treatment was beyond anything I had an explanation for.  \n\nMeanwhile the staff seemed frightened like mistreated surfs, as this subpar medical \"professional\" literally lorded over her practice and patients scooting around on a teeny, tiny wheeled stool rather than walking.   \n\nMy sister has NYC based insurance and this is the only practice that takes it for miles around, otherwise she would not put up with this ill-treatment masquerading as healthcare.\n\nNOTE:  \nI would be remiss if I failed to mention that Dr. Mary Gaffney offers weight loss treatment.

Should be worth paying a higher price per unit for professionalism.\n\nThe facility itself is very pretty, the staff was very courteous and friendly. Although it is a bit \"sales\" vs. \"relaxing\" in the front with the products, etc. it's fine. Consultation was fine as well. My complaint is with our follow-up to receive the treatment itself.\n\nDr. Greenberg sat down with my mother and I and we told him exactly how many units we wanted and in the locations we wanted. We were both very clear with him.  He nodded his head, and simply did whatever he wanted. I say this, because when we got to the front desk to pay, my mother and I then found out he put in DOUBLE what we both explicitly asked for - and we were floored. So instead of paying around $250 as was expected I was now asked to pay more than $450. I was then told, \"Well he puts in what he thinks you need, then you get free touch-ups in 2 weeks if you're not happy with the results.\" Wow. Would have been great to know that upfront. At that point, instead of pushing the issue, we were both actually kind of flustered and embarrassed because there were so many people around. Unfortunately, we left - disappointed and later became angry at what transpired. And if that wasn't enough, the botox didn't even seem to last more than a month! I've NEVER had such an experience with botox, so I'm unsure what happened to the formula, etc. but to pay such an amount and then not even have it last was just adding insult to injury. I didn't go back for the \"touch-up\" because who wants more of that insufficient product in my face? \n\nI tell any friend looking for botox to stay clear of this place. Any facility where they don't listen to your input is not worth visiting. But I'm sure skin treatments, etc. would be fine, I would never recommend anything beyond that at this location.

What the heck are ya gonna do about it, right?\n\nWell, I'll tell you what I did about it - I went to Sona Med Spa in Ballantyne to inquire about a number of treatments.\n\nI'm not usually a vain person, but something just clicked when I hit the big 4-0. There are things that I don't like about my body, and dammit I have the means to do something about them, so why don't I? There's no reason to live with something you don't like if you don't have to.\n\nI visited Sona Med Spa and talked with Cassidy, who gave me pricing on laser hair removal (bikini and underarms) and laser treatments for the rosacea on my face. My leg hair was really too light for laser hair removal, so that was out, but I was sick of shaving the rest. \n\nFor laser hair removal, I had previously visited \"Ideal Image\" for a quote as well. The woman was nice, but she tried to sell me on leg laser hair removal, even though my hair was clearly too light. Sona had MUCH better pricing on the laser hair removal, and I could get the AFT package for my rosacea at a great discount. Both combined were cheaper than the quote I got for just the hair removal at Ideal Image, so I jumped at the offer from Sona.\n\nI figured I'd wait until I was through with most of the package purchases before writing a review. So here I am, after 4 AFT and 4 laser treatments. The AFT has worked great. I had so many broken capillaries and veins on my face that I needed foundation just to look decent. After 4 rounds of AFT, I can't find a broken vein around my nose. My face looks more clear and calm and I don't have nearly as many flushing issues as I used to have.\n\nThe laser hair removal has been a mixed bag. I'm about 50% done with hair removal by my observation, but I only have a couple of sessions left. I will probably need additional sessions for full hair removal. Still, after session 3, I really started to notice a decrease in hair on my bikini line and underarms.  There is still a way to go.\n\nTo be clear: both procedures hurt. Some of them hurt like \"HECK\"! AFT is worse than the laser hair removal for me. (If your hair is dark and coarse, laser hair removal will hurt worse, but mine is medium coarseness, at best.) Sona will provide you with an Rx for a topical anesthetic ointment if you want. After 2 AFT sessions I opted to purchase the ointment. For my 3rd AFT session, I showed up with a face \"numbed\" by the ointment and having popped 4 Ibuprofen preemptively for pain. It was still awful. So awful that I decided to forego the ointment and Ibuprofen for my last session. If you're doing AFT, you kind of just have to suck it up and realize that beauty and even skin tone HURTS. Half of it's psychological. The other half is terrifyingly physical. :-) But if you get Roe, just chat with her and she'll help take your mind off things.\n\nSuffice to say, I celebrated my last session of AFT even though it meant no more sessions with my buddy Roe. \n\nI have to dock Sona Med Spa in Ballantyne a star because sometimes their scheduling is awful. I have waited for 65+ minutes for a 15 minute treatment before. They have lost two of my appointments. Their scheduling is terrible. Now, I get them to write my scheduling down on cards, and I save them like they're lifelines. I once received a call to confirm an appointment, and when I called back to say I could make it, they had LOST the appointment in their system.\n\nThe people at Sona Med Spa Ballantyne are great, but their scheduling system is hideous. Be careful about scheduling and be prepared to wait an hour for your service. If they can see you in 5 minutes after you arrive, it's a bonus!\n\nThat said, I arrived 45 minutes early for an appointment one time, because I had put it in my Outlook calendar for 11 (instead of 11:45 - seriously, save those cards!). When I showed up uber-early, the receptionist took the time to help me schedule all my next appointments AND answered all of my questions about Botox during the time I was waiting. So, as I said, they're good people. Just get firm on your appointment times.\n\nI do like Sona a great deal.

Med spas have botox available every day, so you never know how old it is, which means forehead unfreezes in a shorter amount of time. \n\nI still would like my phone call returned, because I did pay for treatments and I want one.

My friend Dan responded to this news with, \"fell off an obstacle course? Aren't you %& years old? Did you build a treehouse after?\" \n\nSo yes, the girl who played three sports for ten years... who's been drilled with line drives... flipped over a left field fence.... thrown off a horse... ridiculous collisions on layups... finally injured herself for the first time ever on an obstacle course. Life, eh?\n\nI convinced myself Saturday that I didn't need to go to Urgent Care. Or maybe it was Fireball that did the convincing. Either way, I woke up Sunday and said, \"something is definitely wrong.\"\n\nSo, my roomie drove me to OrthoCarolina Urgent Care. First of all, this is the complete opposite of every single Urgent Care I have ever visited. All the others, you wait for hours with strangers coughing and sneezing all over you... only to be looked at by a doctor for 30 seconds. And usually diagnosed incorrectly. Not here. I went right in (after filling out all the necessary paperwork), talked to a nice nurse type person about my injury and then straight to x-ray.\n\nThe doctor went over my x-ray with me, discussed my injury and what I need to do to take care of it. Spoiler alert: there's a break in the top part of my left shoulder. The nurse then fitted me for my sling-type apparatus and sent me on my way with my pain medicine prescription.\n\nI'm terrified of doctors, hospitals.. pretty much pain in general. This was such a pleasant experience, Well, excluding the fact my shoulder is fractured. Everyone was so nice. At one point during x-ray, the technician was making a really awful face while looking at mine. He must've saw the look of panic on my face because he quickly apologized and said he was just trying to figure out the best angle to shoot the next one. Of course, that ended with two more people coming into the room and joining him to make the exact same face. #allofthepanic\n\nI hope I never have to come here again, but if I fall off an obstacle course in the future this will be my go-to place.

When you get copies of xrays, make sure views are individually listed on the disc. If you went to an urgent care facility 1st, you may need to get records there also. #4) Don't delay if you suspect problems.

So, I dropped my Y membership and have been checking out alternatives. I went in to GISFW today for a evaluation & decided to join.  \n\nI normally don't like committing to a year contract for things like a gym membership, but I decided to take a chance and sign up. (I really hope that I do not regret this decision - but you'll be the first to know about it if I do!)\n\nThe GISFW concept isn't for everyone, so let me break down the pros & cons for you.  \n\nPros: \nI like the fact that the place is geared for women. (Some of the gyms I have checked out lately are definitely geared for men --sweaty no-frills gyms-- and some are more like \"meet-markets\" - definitely not what I am looking for!) And I also like the fact that they keep the workouts and the entire program very structured (which I need right now).  In addition, they have a trainer working with small groups (4 women at a time) to coach you while you are working out.  I do like the fact that  they focus on interval & circuit training and the workout is a good balance of strength-training and cardio. Each session is one hour and you start with about 30 mins of strength training - and on different days alternate working your upper or lower body. Then the remainder of the time you do interval cardio on either a treadmill or elliptical machine. The trainers and employees are very nice and seem to really care about their clients. But, they are there to make sure you are working as hard as you can, so they will push you to make sure you aren't just coasting through the workout.  The program also includes nutritional coaching if you are looking to lose weight. \n\nCons:\nIt is pretty pricey and you will have to decide on whether you want to make a 3 month, 6 month, or 1 year commitment. (Obviously, the pricing is lower for the longer time commitment. You also need to determine if you want 3, 4, or 5 sessions per week which also determines how much you'll be paying.) Another \"con\" is the fact that they only take 4 women at a time - so this means that you need to schedule your workouts ahead of time at a time that is not already fully booked. (And if you are going to miss a session, you need to let them know in advance & plan a make-up time.) And finally, the facility is small... as in tiny.  There is enough space for 4 women to do the strength-training circuit while 4 other women are doing their cardio, which is ok.  But, the downside to such a tiny place is that there is only 1 single bathroom which doubles as the changing room (so if you are coming after work, you have to make sure to get there in time to change before your workout is scheduled to start.) Also, there are no showers, so if you want to go out after your workout, you'll need to head home first to hit the shower. (Again, for me not a big deal since I schedule my workouts after work and go straight home afterward.) \n\nBut, at this point, the pros definitely outweigh the cons for me, and I am looking forward to getting serious about getting fit!", "review_id": "bM7VrJgD1tmZNS9m51sS6g", "type": "review", "user_id": "s9I4KMcrHKki44g_eTrYqQ", "business_id": "p7dOBkU96VUG6R5rbpg8YQ"}, {"votes": {"cool": 0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0}, "date": "2013-05-29", "stars": 2, "text": "OK I bought the Living Social and thought this would be a really good way to determine if I want to join this UBER expensive work out facility (can't call it a gym as there are no showers) and I even bought 2 because LS said I could.  \n\nI called to set up my first work out and the lady (Gina) was very rude on the phone.  Not helpful at all and it was very apparent she could care less if I ever showed up.  Since they only schedule 4 women every 1/2 hour she let me know that there was NOTHING available this week unless I could come in at 5 am or after 7pm (5 am with no showers?  seriously?) and she finally concedes that I could come in during the time frame I requested (gave her a 2 hour window) and I was set.  Really should I be having to fight this hard to try out this place that supposedly wants me to join?\n\nSo I show up...early so I can get dressed...I get there and Gina is no where to be seen.  There is a male trainer (thought this place was for women only?) and he has me fill out some paperwork and she finally comes out.  Mind you on the phone she had told me I had to come in prepared to be there for 1 1/2 hours because I was going to work out AND have a consult with her.  So I get dressed and while the ladies there have already started their workout, I am told to jump in 1/2 way through the workout.  \n\nOk so here was my highlight of the whole thing:  the trainer Jay.  He was AWESOME!!  He watched over everyone (remember there are 4 women working out together) and he made sure that my weight was right, my form was right, etc.  It was great!  \n\nAfter my workout I was supposed to get with Gina again for my consultation.  What did I get?  NOTHING.  I got told how to sign up in their book to schedule workouts only guess what, there was nothing available...except at 5am.  She proceeds to bitch about how they are too busy and how they shouldn't have run the Living Social and how they are so full.  I got no nutritional plan, no discussion about anything.  Just a cranky bitch and shoved out the door.  so I have 30 days to get 12 workouts in and have no idea when I can since the earliest time I could get in is Saturday at 9am...going from a Tuesday work out to a Saturday workout, not really my idea of an exercise plan.\n\nCould I recommend this place?  Not sure.  The trainer is awesome, but when you pay to work out and there is no time available for you to work out, then what is the point?

It's been 3 weeks now and I love that place. Julie and Jay are awesome trainers who are energetic and happy to see you. They walk you through your workouts and constantly ask about your nutrition and eating (which is good...makes you responsible and stays on track). Gina was so helpful with the meal options, and because I'm a vegetarian, she met with Julie (who is also veggie) to make sure I had the correct meat substitutes. \nSometimes I'll go in and there will be 3 other women in my workout session and sometimes it's just a one on one....either way it's great and I can talk to the trainers.

They keep you on track and make sure you are doing your workouts correctly and that you stay challenged. They also hold you accountable in terms of your weigh-ins and provide ongoing nutritional coaching. \n\nNumber one con is the cost. It is less expensive than having a one-on-one personal trainer to workout with 3xs a week, but way more expensive than a traditional  gym. (To work out 3 times a week for a one year membership, you are looking at around $3084 which they expect you to pay upfront.)  \n\nWhile the expense can be an issue, I do think it is an important investment in your health.  My experience was worth the $$ and I have no regrets about having joined for a year.  \n\nFor now my year membership is up, so I am back at the Y and continue doing the same exercise routines that I learned at GISFW.

I have read a few good reviews on it and since I've been fighting  infertility, my husband and I decided to go there for help. At our consultation we were given a print out of everything that will and won't be covered by our insurance; everything looked great so we started treatments. By my second round of treatments I was told nothing was being covered by insurance and I found out it was because of coding issues, after going back and forth with them and my insurance I was told all they needed to do was fix the code and my appointments would be covered 100% and Dr. Katz refused to take the time to do it and now we're stuck with a very large bill. The billing department called me over our balance and after explaining what happened, they didn't care at all to help, I told them I was going to call them back in a few days to discuss the balance and figure out payment arrangements. Like I said I would, I called back and called back, left message after message and no one will return my calls to get this taken care of and they were talking about sending my account over to a collections agency!! They claim they provide compassionate customized care for every patient, but that isn't true; when you walk in the door you're treated as a number, you're in and out of your appointment so fast it will make your head spin. They don't take the time to explain things, answer questions, or anything except during the initial consultation. You don't even get to see your own doctor. I saw Dr. Katz at my consultation and didn't see him again after that, I only saw Dr. Whitesides for a total of 2 minutes while he did each ultrasound at each of my appointments. \nDon't think that this is the only place to go for help if you are battling infertility, there are other great places out there that don't nickle and dime you. Thankfully I found an OBGYN who does infertility monitoring and treatments and they are working with my insurance to get my appointments covered 100% and their charges are worlds different than REACH. IUI at my new doctor is $365 not including medication, IUI at REACH is well over $700 and that isn't including the appointments and medication. Save yourself the stress and money and look for somewhere better so you're not stuck dealing with what I've been dealing with.", "review_id": "qQLVAH1wGFdpv32mOHx-uA", "type": "review", "user_id": "2BcbZh55JSLt_2mEcbc9eg", "business_id": "NuH3dEiBsRzp736ftxRaKw"}, {"votes": {"cool": 0, "useful": 9, "funny": 0}, "date": "2013-10-23", "stars": 1, "text": "Good luck talking with anyone. Horrible IVR system that ensures you go to voicemail every time. \n\nYou will meet with your doctor during the consultation and only if they are in the rotation the day of your visit.\n\n\nYour voicemails are returned a little before 4pm. This I due to the fact that they do not answer calls after 4pm. So answer every call or you have to wait 12 hrs to speak someone.\n\nWe were quoted a price for IUI of $800 plus medicine due to the special they were running on IUIs. Here is where it gets interesting. My husband informs the doctor he was on testosterone gel and the doctor requested an analysis. The doctor stated the IUI would be delayed due to the required analysis. That message was never passed down to anyone else. We receive a call asking for the $800 for the IUI. We informed them it was delayed for one month. They said that was okay but we still needed to pay. So we did. REACH also scheduled an appointment for me to come in for a visit. I came in, different doctor came in, did the monitoring, and left. While I was getting dressed, I noticed an envelope on my purse. I look inside and there are prescriptions. No explanation given. I call to ask why I was given prescriptions since we were delayed for one month. The nurse said we will have to cancel it. \n\nHere we are a month later, receiving a call asking for $235 from a place in Florida. We have to call REACH to find out what was going on. Surprise! Voicemail. Left a message at 9am and received a callback at 4pm. The lady in billing informed us the $235 was for our 2nd IUI. I stated that we have not had our first IUI. She state yes we have completed one IUI. After I informed her that we have not completed the first IUI, she placed me on hold to go and confirm. 10 minutes later she returned and agreed that I had not complete my first IUI. Then she went on to inform me that we owed $235 for canceling the first IUI. I was shocked. I told her we never scheduled an IUI due to waiting for an analysis for my husband. She stated we cancelled so we owe the $235. Wow!\n\nDr. Katz is the nicest person in the world. The administration is one big cluster at REACH with no customer service skills.

I went to Reach thinking I was getting top notch treatment for infertility.  I trusted them and when I was told there was nothing they could do for my \"unexplained infertility\" I left with crushed dreams and a very broken heart. Recently, while seeing another doctor for routine women's healthcare, the reason for my infertility was diagnosed . I'd long since closed the door to the hopes of motherhood and so I was understandably shocked when a doctor, treating a totally different issue, was able to diagnose something Reach told me was unexplainable. Upon reviewing my medical records from my time at Reach, I noticed that the exact diagnosis I've just been given was \"suspected\"  during my two years with Reach but was always written off though no testing was done to rule it out.  I am devastated at the thought that for eight years I have been dealing with emotional fallout of never being able to parent a child when the entire time I could have been easily diagnosed and treated. Shame on you Reach for not taking the time EACH patient deserves and giving them thorough exams and testing. \n\nBe warned, this place may have award winning doctors but you will be nothing more than a number to them and if you do not fit a cookie cutter diagnosis, they will toss you to the side and forget about you.

I had to call the insurance company to get the correct ICD 9 codes for billing...really?????\nPeople tell you not to stress out when you are trying to conceive however all I have is stress over this place.

I did not want to write an angry review fueled by my emotions. Finally, I am ready to share the facts about my experience to those that are really going to need it.\n\n1. Everyone there is incredibly helpful and friendly until they receive your loan. Once they receive the money from your loan, do not expect any of your calls or emails to be returned. (The way it works there is every procedure must be paid for up front. Unfortunately our insurance does not cover anything related to fertility, so after talking to our financial counselor and determining how much we would need we decided a loan was in our best interest. The loan they tell you to apply for goes straight to REACH.) \n\n2. If you go the loan route, I recommend taking out a personal loan, even through the same company ( for example, the lending club) so that way you are in control over how much money REACH receives. Before you pay them a dime ask for itemized bills. Otherwise, you take out this loan for a few thousand and the office stops communicating with you. There is no way to know what each service is costing. Do not bother asking anyone other the financial counselor what the services cost because no one seems to have a clue. We were told by our financial counselor that the IUI and monitoring/testing included was one flat rate which was incorrect. We ended up still owing them money after the loan was used up. We were told we would have money left over and receive a check for that amount. That was also not the case. We were always told we would receive an itemized list of what our loan was covering and only received a complicated and almost cryptic ledger at the end after we threatened them with a lawyer.\n\n3. They stopped returning our calls/ emails before the IUI procedure took place. It's bad business practice to not return a client or patient's messages regardless. However, this put an incredible amount of stress on me and my husband. Any amount of unnecessary stress while trying to conceive is harmful to the conception process. Our first round of IUI was unsuccessful. I am not at all surprised. My gripe isn't with the IUI not working on our first try, but with the way they treat their patients. \n\n4. During the IUI procedure itself, Dr. Johnson had trouble inserting the catheter which resulted in a lot of pain and severe cramps. She changed catheters several times, then asked for the tech to use the ultrasound to determine where it was in the uterus. The doctor then said, and I repeat verbatim, \"I THINK it's in the right spot\" and completed the procedure. I don't think anything else needs to be said about that except my husband and I were shocked. We had no words. \n\n5. Over the course of several weeks trying to get in touch with someone at REACH to help us and answer our questions, my husband finally got in touch with someone and relayed our complaint. She apologized and recommended we email the Executive Director with our experience. It has now been almost a month, we have received no phone call or email from the Executive Director regarding our experience. Sadly, I have a feeling he gets these complaints all the time. Sadly the reviews for REACH prove that this has been an ongoing issue for several years now. \n\nUPDATE: It is important to you to know that there was no record of my IUI procedure. No procedure note, no documentation whatsoever. I paid the fee to obtain my records and the records were incomplete. We asked for the records for the IUI and were told that they only document if something goes wrong or if it results in successful pregnancy. There is no way that can be true or legal. We sent them an email with one last request for them to right their wrong. This email was sent to two of their doctors, the executive director, and a financial counselor. Not one person has cared to respond. We will be disputing the charges with the financing company, as well as filing a formal complaint with Mecklenburg Co and a formal complaint with the Medical Board. It could have been so easy. Nothing we asked for was unreasonable. It is absolutely appalling that they would treat their patients this way.

The Nurse Practitioner who saw me was very nice, but appeared mostly disinterested in me.  Once she ruled out the flu, it seemed as though she was eager to get me out of there.  She really gave me no time to talk about my concerns or about how my body usually reacts to respiratory illness, and, despite all the glowing reports I've heard about next-day follow-up phone calls to check on patients, I got none of that.  Quite frankly, she appeared a bit bored with the whole thing.  To further compound matters, she took a phone call while in the exam room with me (although she apologized for doing so).

Oh and even if you take a narcotic (even though they say they work with your physician) they have it posted in small print no narcotics. I was having a panic attack and in diabetic keto acidosis. This doctor who I have no idea who he is is not stating the truth. If I am fabricating something why not take it up a level? It was most definitely in fine print at the bottom of the page. But this was not my medical need. I needed insulin. And I sat in the corner up against the wall I can post my taxi receipts to prove my arrival time! I waited an awful long time before anyone even came up to the front so no sir you do not know when I entered. You only witnessed me filling out the computer after I had sat in the waiting room for a very very long time. I even kept trying to hand your employee my insurance info and you had to tell her to turn around. She was angry because I had started doing her job for her because as I have already stated no one was up front for a good 10 minutes. She heard my phone call to my physician and their advice to come to them that with my type 1 condition I cannot afford to wait!!!!! So my advice if you want a sports medical form filled out this is your guy. But if you are in need of immediate help this is not your guy!!! I will in his defense state that from my gut feeling about a person I thought him to be a very nice guy. After reading his comments below I can't even say that now. You do not call people dishonest sir. That can get you in trouble especially if I can prove what I am saying and you cannot. I did however hear people talking while I was waiting. My advice for this doctor maybe put a bell on your door or something. You all had no idea I was even there. As I stated I sat for awhile before I took it upon myself to do your receptionists job. Ok I have sat and thought about this situation a bit. I have some responsibility in this situation as well. I should have made my presence known. I don't know if anyone reading this has ever had a panic attack or had a reading on your meter that just said hi but it is very scary. It is true that once the doctor realized I was there  he did try to get things moving. He pointed to me because I standing there with my arm outstretched trying to give the receptionist my insurance. It is also true that I did wait and it is also true that even though the receptionist had my information she did not do anything with it. After I made my phone call to my physicians office I walked back up to her desk and she still had my id and insurance card and had not done anything with them. I think I am judging the doctor a bit too harshly. I believe he wanted to help. Also he had no idea what was going on with me I did not give him a chance. So in retrospect the fault is mine for not doing what I could to get help and announce my presence and the receptionists for not being at her desk and for treating me like I wasn't there for an emergency. That is what I believed this place to be. My criticism of the doctor is not fair he never spoke to me and had no idea. I believe if I had been a better advocate for myself he would have done his very best. I did get that feeling from him especially after he refocused his receptionist back to me. To summarize please get a bell on the door or if you are in a bad spot like I was be your own advocate and state what you need. In my defense I was very upset and disoriented. In the doctors defense he had no idea how could he? I didn't say anything.", "review_id": "sNijdcZ5z34m3R-6JY4_Iw", "type": "review", "user_id": "HNHGpYe_jgXka1SAwnilsQ", "business_id": "r0iusLRxzbe2zuFxqQj3Nw"}, {"votes": {"cool": 0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0}, "date": "2014-12-08", "stars": 5, "text": "As one that does not have a strong love for hospitals or seeking medical treatment,  when the time came recently, I have nothing but praise for the women and men of Carolina Medical Center Steele Creek.

Over 5 hrs plus they ran one test said its nothing major for what we can see and said to call your pcp even though we said we didn't have one yet because we just moved here. It took 3 hrs and 45 mins to just see the doctor and when we brought that up, we were told that's normal as they only staff 1 doctor at night. To me my first thought is patient care is not number 1 if you have 15 plus beds and all are filled with emergencies. The doctor ran a test which took over an hr of course. They gave no direction as what else the issue could be other than saying according to the test its not appendix which if you research doesn't always appear on cat scans... They did no other testing. After waiting another 30mins to be released I finally tracked down a nurse asking if they could take out the iv so we could leave. The repose was rude saying everyone thinks their problem is the most important!! Then he stormed in the room and started arguing with us about the wait time being normal. We finally got our papers and left. Everyone on staff was rude, short and were treated like another number. They checked the box and moved on to the next person.
